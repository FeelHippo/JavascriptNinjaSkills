  // "final" means single-assignment: a final variable or field *must* have an initializer.

  // "const" has a meaning that's a bit more complex and subtle in Dart.
  // const modifies *values*. You can use it when creating collections, like const [1, 2, 3],
  // and when constructing objects (instead of new) like const Point(2, 3).
  // Here, const means that the object's entire deep state can be determined entirely at compile time
  // and that the object will be frozen and completely immutable.
  const List<int> list = [1, 2, 3];
  const carInstance = Car();

  list = [...list, 4]; //  Error: Can't assign to the const variable 'list'
}

// "static" means a member is available on the class itself instead of on instances of the class.
// That's all it means,nd it isn't used for anything else. static modifies *members*.
