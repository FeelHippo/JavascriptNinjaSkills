<!-- WHAT IS REST -->

## What is REST

**REST** is an acronym for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer and an architectural **style** for distributed hypermedia systems.

**REST is not a protocol or a standard**, it is an architectural style. During the development phase, API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.

A Web API (or Web Service) conforming to the REST architectural style is called a REST API (or RESTful API).

REST is based on some constraints and principles that promote simplicity, scalability, and statelessness in the design. There are six guiding principles:

The key **abstraction of information** in REST is a **resource**. Any information that we can name can be a resource. For example, a REST resource can be a document or image, a temporal service, a collection of other resources, or a non-virtual object (e.g., a person).

The state of the resource, at any particular time, is known as the **resource representation**. The resource representations consist of:

- the **data**
- the **metadata** describing the data
- and the **hypermedia links** that can help the clients transition to the next desired state.

<!-- UNIFORM INTERFACE -->

### Uniform Interface

REST defines a consistent and uniform interface for interactions between clients and servers. 

For example, the HTTP-based REST APIs make use of the standard HTTP methods (**GET, POST, PUT, DELETE**, etc.) and the URIs (**Uniform Resource Identifiers**) to **uniquely** identify resources.

<!-- CLIENT SERVER -->

### Client Server

The client-server design pattern enforces the separation of concerns, which helps the client and the server components evolve independently.

<!-- STATELESS -->

### Stateless

Statelessness mandates that each request from the client to the server must contain all of the information necessary to understand and complete the request.

The server cannot take advantage of any previously stored context information on the server.

For this reason, the client application must entirely keep the session state.

<!-- CACHEABLE -->

### Cacheable

The cacheable constraint requires that a response should implicitly or explicitly label itself as cacheable or non-cacheable.

If the response is cacheable, the client application gets the right to reuse the response data later for equivalent requests and a specified period.

<!-- LAYERED SYSTEM -->

### Layered System

In a layered system, each component cannot see beyond the immediate layer they are interacting with.

A laymanâ€™s example of a layered system is the [MVC pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC). The MVC pattern allows for a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale the application.

<!-- CODE ON DEMAND -->

### Code on Demand (Optional)

REST also allows client functionality to extend by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts.

<!-- WHAT IS ACID -->

## What is ACID

ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a **set of properties of database transactions** intended to **guarantee data validity** despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. 

In the context of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties (which can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data) is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- ATOMICITY -->

### Atomicity

Transactions are often composed of multiple statements. Atomicity guarantees that **each transaction is treated as a single "unit"**, which either succeeds completely or fails completely: if **any** of the statements constituting a transaction fails to complete, the **entire transaction fails** and the database is left unchanged.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- CONSISTENCY -->

### Consistency

Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database **from one consistent state to another**, and any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- ISOLATION -->

### Isolation

Transactions are often executed concurrently (e.g., multiple transactions reading and writing to a table at the same time). Isolation ensures that **concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially**.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- DURABILITY -->

### Durability

Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will **remain committed even in the case of a system failure**.
